// Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

let friendName: string[] = ['saqib', 'ali', 'waleed', 'jawad'];

console.log(`hello ${friendName [0]}, how are you`)
console.log(`hello ${friendName [1]}, how are you`)
console.log(`hello ${friendName [2]}, how are you`)
console.log(`hello ${friendName [3]}, how are you`)
